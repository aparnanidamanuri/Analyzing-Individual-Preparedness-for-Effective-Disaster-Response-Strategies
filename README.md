# Analyzing-Individual-Preparedness-for-Effective-Disaster-Response-Strategies
This repository explores individual preparedness levels and their relationship to effective disaster response strategies. It implements machine learning techniques to analyze factors influencing preparedness and aims to inform the development of targeted disaster response plans.

## Project Goals

1. Identify key factors influencing individual preparedness for disasters.
2. Develop machine learning models to predict preparedness levels based on various socio-demographic factors.
3. Utilize the models' insights to suggest effective disaster response strategies tailored to different preparedness levels.

## Research Questions
1. How do demographic factors correlate with preparedness levels in disaster-prone regions?
2. What is the distribution of preparedness levels across different states, and how can it be effectively quantified?
3. To what extent do awareness, perception and past experiences influence preparedness levels?
4. How can insights from studying individual preparedness and response behaviors contribute to more effective disaster management strategies?

## Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

A dataset containing socio-demographic information and preparedness levels is collected.
The data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.
Feature engineering techniques are applied to create new informative features.

### 2. Feature Selection:

Techniques like F-scores and mutual information are used to identify the most relevant features for predicting preparedness levels.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Training:

Machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting, Stacking and Neural networks are trained on the prepared data.
The models learns the relationships between features and preparedness levels.

### 4. Model Evaluation:

The models' performance are evaluated on a held-out test set using metrics like classification report and confusion matrix.
The evaluation helps assess the models' accuracy and identify potential areas for improvement.

### 5. Results

The project will document the chosen features, the machine learning models' performance, and key insights gained from the analysis.
Visualizations like charts and graphs are included to illustrate the findings.
